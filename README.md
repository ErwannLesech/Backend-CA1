# What is this project about ?

This project aims to provide users with a virtual garage in which they can register their motorcycles by name, brand, and description. The primary purpose of this project is to offer a simple and efficient way for users to keep track of their motorcycle collection.


# What are the limitations ?

Currently, the application lacks the ability to share opinions on motorcycles or filter motorcycles by brand. These limitations may impact the user experience for those looking for specific types of motorcycles or seeking to engage with other users about their shared interests.


# What can be improved in the future ?

In the future, I plan to implement a new class to allow each user to add opinions on a registered motorcycle. Additionally, I aim to add motorcycle categories to the application, which will enable users to filter their collection based on their specific interests. Another possible improvement could be to integrate a search function to make it easier for users to find specific motorcycles within their collection.


# How did I process ?

The development process began by creating the "garage" application and implementing the primary model to enable motorcycle registration. The next step involved adding CRUD functions to the application, followed by the development of HTML templates and CSS to enhance the user experience and overall look and feel of the application. To ensure the application is secure, I added user authentication and authorization features to protect user data. Finally, I conducted extensive testing to ensure the application functions correctly and is free of bugs and errors.
